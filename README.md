## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/AmanPandita/DjangoWebApp.git
```

2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies:

```
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
```

3. Install the required packages:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Configure the database settings in `DjangoWebApp/settings.py` to match your database setup. If you're using PostgreSQL, you can use the following template:

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'your_db_name',
        'USER': 'your_db_user',
        'PASSWORD': 'your_db_password',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}
```

5. Run the following commands to create the required tables in the database:

```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

6. Create a superuser to access the admin panel:

```
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

## Usage

1. Start the development server:

```
python manage.py runserver
```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to view the application.

3. Access the admin panel by visiting http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ and logging in with the superuser credentials.
